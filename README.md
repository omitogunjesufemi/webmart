# Project Title: webmart
A simple e-commerce website with features like product listings, shopping cart, and order history.

This project involves working with databases, user authentication, and building a responsive UI with React.

Webmart uses an headless architecture. This separates the frontend (user interface â€“ UI) from the backend (business logic) layer of the website. This way, even most mature businesses gain the maneuverability and flexibility of a start-up.
